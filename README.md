# SuperGraphicsEngine

## Target

-This project is a simple implementation of 3d graphics engine.

-The main purpose is to help me and hopely others to understand how rendering pipeline works. This will very unlikely be a program that has too much value for applications.

### Technical information

-The aim is to make a system, that can calculate a value for a pixel in the screen based on given mesh (which are to be defined later), camera, lightning, and other instructions for the mesh rendering.

-Project language will not be important. Only requirements from the language are that it supports object orientated programming and that there exists a library with the possibility to give a value to a pixel in screen. So this should be easy to implement with c++, Python, Java or even R and Matlab. No need for GPU support.

## ENJOY!
